# Group

The `<Group>` component is a container for images. The component establishes a 12 column
CSS grid and distributes the images according to their constraints and desired configuration:

 - **Aspect Ratio**: each image can define what its ideal aspect ratio is.
 - **Span**: The column and row span which should be covered by each image.

Note that images are stretched vertically to cover the whole grid area, so the height of each
row is effectively determined by the width and aspect ratio of the tallest image.

<Exhibit bleed={8} style={{ margin: "1rem 0" }}>
  <Sample variant="basic" />
</Exhibit>

## Responsive Behaviour

The **span** can be set to change at specific breakpoints. The following example uses
a 6/6/12 configuration on small viewports, and 4/3/5 on large viewports.
