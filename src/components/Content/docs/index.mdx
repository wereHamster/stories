# Content

Container for the story content. It establishes a CSS grid layout with a specific
configuration of columns:

 - **center**: a center column which has a max width such that text remains readable and isn't
   displayed in too wide lines. Content is placed into this column unless instructed
   otherwise.
 - **extended**: when space permits, two columns to the left and right of the center column are
   created for content which needs to be displayed slightly wider than the text.
   These side columns have a max width as well and do not extend all the way to
   the viewport edges.
 - **full**: the rest of the space outside of the side columns is made available for blocks
   which need to extend all the way to the edges of the viewport.

Note that there is always a bit of margin between the **center** and **extended** columns
and the viewport edges. While the **full** column extends all the way to the edge of the
viewport.
