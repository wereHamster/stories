I’m fortunate enough that I can work from wherever there is good internet. That
covers a lot of this earths surface – and airspace. I’m also pretty flexible
when it comes to working hours. This gives me plenty of options how to structure
my day: If it’s raining I can stay home and work a bit more. If it’s sunny
outside I can go work outside. If there’s thermal activity I can go flying. If
I don’t feel productive I can… simply be.

In early February 2021 I was still hurting, and wanted to leave Switzerland once
more. Not for vacation though, I wanted the new place to feel like home. Me
living there, working from there. This meant staying for at least a few weeks.

It wasn't easy to find a country that is in the right time zone such that I
don’t have to get up in the middle of the night for meetings, has good internet,
is warm and cheap, and offers good spots to fly my paraglider.

My original plan was to go to Morocco. I had the airline ticket and accomodation
for the first few days sorted out, was ready to leave Switzerland. But I only
made it to the check-in where the airline informed me that Morocco doesn't allow
tourists enter the country – a sudden decision in light of the then increasing
number of COVID cases. Oh well, such is life and travel in corona times…

was still open to tourists. And winter is the paragliding season there. Booked!

Wait, not so fast! To make sure to not get rejected at the check-in again I
called the airline to make sure they would let me board this time. After
receiving a confirmation that I won't be turned away again I booked the ticket.

This time though I was smart enough to book my accomodation only after landing
and getting through immigration.

I wasn't expecting many tourists on the island, it was off-season after all, and
COVID was still raging all around the world. But the number of people I saw was
way lower than even that.

Could there be a reason why the island seemed that deserted? Did I miss
something important, was the island perhaps in a dire COVID situation, with
everything locked down, shops closed, and a high incidence rate?

None of my scary thoughts proved true. It was pretty much business as usual on
the island. I think it was just the combination of being off-season, and the
general public being afraid of traveling. Life on Tenerife was relaxed.

A few weeks into my stay I started seeing more and more people in the streets
and on the beaches. Mostly spaniards, but also a many czech people, and people
from the baltic states.

I met few germans, and just a handful of swiss people in total during my five
weeks – even though the flight from ZRH to TFS was full.

Many young people I've met have been on Tenerife for many months already. They
came in waves. Whenever a country tightened the restrictions a bunch of them
would flock to Tenerife. Usually with the goal to stay until the conditions in
their home country improve, but many stayed for far longer. I can see why they
don't want to move back.

Tenerife is the largest island of the Canary Islands. It's still small enough so
that you can do a day trip to the other side of the island. Yet despite its
small size, it packs many different climate zones: dry and barren landscapes in
the south, lush green vegetation in the north, warm weather down by the sea,
snow on mount Teide.

<Image

  caption="Waves crashing onto shore at Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife."
/>

The permanent trade winds push moist air onto the north-east shores. As the
moisture in the raising air condenses, clouds form. The cloud base is
consistently at about 800 to 1100 meters above the sea, leaving the plateau
around mount Teide under clear blue skies.

This also means the northern side of the island is often covered in clouds. The
quickest way to escape them is to drive up the mountain. Because the clouds are
so low, it doesn't take long until you punch through them.

The only sign of COVID on Tenerife was the fact that face masks were mandatory
in shops, restaurants, but also in open spaces.

People were generally following the rules. I even met some walking through the
national park, nobody around them for miles, in winds of 20km/h and yet they
were wearing masks. Rules are rules, right?

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stories.caurea.org/one-more-rush/IMG_3321.jpeg" caption="IMG_3321.jpeg" />

Police was frequently patrolling the streets and making sure everyone was
wearing a mask. Everyone that is except those jogging, biking, or doing any
other even mildly strenuous activity. It didn't make sense: the harder you
breathe the more droplets you spread and inhale.

Another trick to avoid having to weark a mask was to grab an ice cream in one of
the many ice cream stands. That freedom wouldn't last long though, as any ice
cream would quickly melt in the hot air.

Wild camping is strictly forbidden, especially in the Teide National Park. But
if you pitch the tent after sunset and pack just after sunrise you can escape
unseen. If you do decide to camp wild, please make sure to leave nothing behind.

Nights were cold. It was April, spring has just begun, and lack of clouds means
energy easily escapes into outer space.

The sunrise though was well worth it. I was living on the south-west side of the
island, with little chance to catch a beautiful sunrise. There were few
occasions to do so, and nights spent high up in the Teide National Park offered
those.

The north-western tip of the island is a landscape of deep gorges, winding
roads, and tiny villages. It's the only region on the western side of the island
where you'll see that much green. Even just a few kilometers to the south you'll
find a completely different landscape: dry and rocky, with few vegetation
outside of the many palm plantations.

Costa Adeje on the eastern side of the island is one of the few places which
offers shallow, wide, sandy beaches. It's one of the more modern places on the
island, with bars, luxury shops, and five-star hotels plastered all over the
coast.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stories.caurea.org/one-more-rush/IMG_4148.jpeg" caption="IMG_4148.jpeg" />

It was my favourite place to spend the evenings. In just a few minutes drive
from my apartment I could be on clean, wide, almost empty beaches.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stories.caurea.org/one-more-rush/IMG_4860.jpeg" caption="IMG_4860.jpeg" />

I'd make sure to bring a cold cider and dark chocolate, put on some relaxing
music, and keep my eyes wide open to capture the colorful sunsets.

If the cloud cover was too thick, I would drive to _Mirador de los Poleos_ – a
viewpoint just high enough to be above the lower cloud cover. From there you
also get a nice view on the two neighbouring islands to the west, _La Gomera_
and _La Palma_.

To the east, on the opposite side where the sun sets is mount Teide. As the sun
slowly descends behind the horizon, you can watch the volcano change color from
yellow to orange to red to violett, until it is at last fully engulfed in
earth's shadow.

After the sun sets it still takes a while for the night sky to reveals itself.
It's well worth waiting the couple hours until the last remants of the sun
disappear from the horizon. Because only then will you get a clear view of the
night sky, see the milky way in its fullest beauty, and perhaps even spot a
strip of Starlink satellites crossing the sky like a row of ducks (Space X had
launched another batch of Starlink satellites just one day prior to me trying to
stargaze).

Continuing further along the road to _Mirador de los Poleos_ will lead you to
the Teide National Park. The park covers most of the center of the island,
around mount Teide, and offers many hiking trails on the plateau and up to some
of the peaks.

The hike up to the top of mount Teide isn’t too strenuous, but it’s not an easy
walk either. A group of italian tourists made it to the top, proving that it's
doable even in sneakers. I admired their dedication.

There are two trails, one from the east, and another one from the south-west.
The later is longer, but nicer. It goes past the second-highest peak of Tenerife
– Pico Viejo – a volcano with a far larger crater than the one at the top.

Pico Viejo is a good place to rest and gather your strength before continuing to
the very top. The peak seems within reach, but don't be mistaken, it takes
another two hours to get there.

To get to the very top of Teide you need a permit. This restriction is in place
to limit the damage to the fragile ecosystem around the peak. It's not the few
responsible hikers that the park is concerned about, but the hundreds of
visitors every day who take the cable cark to a station just a couple hundred
meters below the peak.

The staff guarding the gate leaves with the last cable car at around 5pm. So if
you plan your hike accordingly, you can walk right past the gate to the top.

The crater at the very top isn’t particularly pretty, but you get to enjoy a 360
panoramic view on Tenerife and also the surrounding islands.

While I’m sure that watching the sunset from the top would be a unique
experience, I wouldn’t want to walk down in the dark. Walking on volcanic stones
requires a lot of concentration, doing that in complete darkness - even if you
had a strong headlight - doubly so.

And it gets cold up there. Don't forget that the peak is at 3700 meters above
the sea!

I was running down and was lucky to make it to the car just as the night was
setting in. If I had left the peak a couple minutes later, I'd be walking in
complete darkness.

My apartment was in _Las Galletas_. When I first entered that town I felt like
in a different country. I found myself walking through dark, narrow, lifeless
streets, between worn down buildings and steel bars covering doors and windows
of every shop, restarant and private residence (which I took as an indication of
a high crime rate).

It was such a stark contrast to Adeje and Los Christianos, which are just a
couple minutes drive away. I'm sure it must have been a nice place years ago,
when the buildings and parks were freshly built. But in 2021 the town felt
almost abandoned.

One of the reasons why I chose Tenerife is because it's well known for its good,
stable flying conditions, almost all year around. And indeed, there were few
days where flying wasn't possible.

A few kilometers to the east of Las Galletas is the small town _El Medano_.
Being located on the southern coast of the island, it enjoys near constant winds
from the east, making it a famous kitesurfing spot.

It seemed like a modern, young, vibrant town. If you're into kitesurfing it's
definitely worth staying there.

While walking towards the beach, not really paying attention to anything around
me, I suddenly found myself standing just a couple meters away from paramedics
bent over a person lying on the ground. I turned right around and walked away.
On my way back to the car I saw the person being loaded into a hearse.

One of the last nights on the island I spent again out in the wild. It was still
cold.
