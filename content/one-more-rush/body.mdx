I can’t afford not working for long periods of time, I’d eventually run out of
money. But I’m fortunate enough that I can work from wherever there is good
internet. And that covers a lot of this earths surface (and airspace).

I’m also pretty flexible when it comes to working hours. This gives me plenty of
options how to structure my day.

If it’s raining I can stay home and work a bit more. If it’s cloudy outside I
can go work at a cafe. If there’s thermal activity I can go flying. If I don’t
feel productive I can… chill.

It was difficult to find a country that is in the right time zone such that I
don’t have to get up in the middle of the night for meetings, has good internet,
is warm and cheap, and is flyable during that time of year.

My original plan was to go to Morocco, stay for a few weeks, work, travel, fly.
I had the ticket and accomodation for the first few days sorted out, was ready
to leave Switzerland. But I only made it to the check-in where the airline
informed me that the country doesn’t want tourists after all. Oh well, such is
life and travel in corona times…

Back to the drawing board. After a bit of research, I found that Tenerife was
still open to tourists. And winter is the paragliding season there. Booked!

Wait, not so fast. To make sure to not get rejected at the check-in again I
called the {air,hot}line and made sure the country is indeed open. After
receiving a confirmation that I won't be turned away again I booked the ticket.

This time though I was smart enough to book my accomodation only after landing
and getting through immigration.

I wasn't expecting many tourists on the island, it was off-season after all, and
COVID was still raging all around the world. But the number of people I saw was
way lower than even that.

Could there be a reason why the island seemed that deserted? Did I miss
something important, was the island perhaps in a really dire COVID situation,
with everything locked down, shops closed, and a high incidence rate?

None of my scary thoughts proved true. It was pretty much business as usual on
the island. I think it was just the combination of being off-season, and the
general public being afraid of traveling. Life on Tenerife was relaxing for the
first few weeks.

Later more people started pouring onto the island. I saw mostly spaniards, but
also a many czech, italian people, and people from the Baltic states.

I met few germans, and just a handful of swiss people in total during my five
weeks (even though the flight from ZRH to TFS was full).

Many young people I've met have been on Tenerife for many months already. They
came in waves. Whenever a country tightened the restrictions a bunch of people
would move to Tenerife. Usually with the goal to stay until the conditions
improve, but many stayed for far longer. I can see why they don't want to move
back.

Tenerife is the largest island of the Canary Islands. It's still small enough so
that you can do a day trip to the other side of the island. But despite its
small size, it packs many different climate zones: dry and barren landscapes in
the south, lush green vegetation in the north, warm weather down by the sea,
snow on mount Teide.

<Image
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stories.caurea.org/one-more-rush/IMG_3263.jpeg"
  caption="Waves crashing onto shore at Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife."
/>

The permanent trade winds push moist air onto the north-east shores. As the
moisture in the raising air condenses, it forms clouds. The cloud base is
consistently at about 800 to 1100 meters above the sea, leaving the plateau
around mount Teide under clear skies.

This also means the northern side of the island is often covered in clouds. The
quickest way to escape them is to drive up the mountain. Because the clouds are
so low, it doesn't take long until you punch through them.

The only sign of COVID on Tenerife was the fact that face masks were mandatory
in shops, restaurants, but also in open spaces.

People were generally following the rules. I even met some walking through the
national park, not a soul within hundreds of meters of them, in winds of 20km/h
and they were wearing masks. Rules are rules, right?

But then on the beaches hardly anyone had a mask on their face. And people doing
sports (eg. jogging) wouldn't wear any either.

The only dangerous-looking animal I came across was these tiny beetles on trails
within the Teide National Park.

Wild camping is strictly forbidden, especially in the Teide National Park. But
if you pitch the tent after sunset and pack just after sunrise you can escape
unseen. If you do decide to wild camp, please make sure to leave nothing behind.

Nights were cold. It was April, spring has just begun, and lack of clouds means
energy easily escapes into outer space.

The sunrise though was well worth it. I was living on the south-west side of the
island, with little chance to catch a beautiful sunrise. There were few
occasions to do so, and nights above the clouds offered them.

The north western tip of the island is a landscape of deep gorges, winding
roads, and tiny villages. It's the last time you see see green vegetation when
continuing further south.

Costa Adeje on the eastern side of the island is one of the few places which
offers shallow, wide, sandy beaches.

five-star hotels plastered all over the coast.

It was my favourite place to spend the evenings. In just a few minutes drive
from my apartment I could be on clean, wide, almost empty beaches.

With a cider and dark chocolate, music in my ears, and eyes wide open to capture
the colorful sunsets.

If the cloud cover was too thick, I would drive to _Mirador de los Poleos_ – a
viewpoint just high enough to above the lower cloud cover.

From that viewpoint you also get a nice view on the two neighbouring islands to
the west, _La Gomera_ and _La Palma_.

From that viewpoint you also see mount Teide. And as the sun slowly descends
behind the horizon, you can see how the volcano changes color from yellow to
orange to red to violett, until it is at last fully engulfed in earth's shadow.

After the sun sets it still takes a while until the night sky reveals itself.
It's well worth waiting the couple hours for the last remants of the sun to
disappear from the horizon. Because only then will you get a nice, clear view of
the sky, see the milky way in its fullest beauty, and perhaps even spot a strip
of Starlink satellite crossing the sky like a row of ducks (Space X had launched
another batch of Starlink satellites just one day prior to me trying to
stargaze).

Continuing further along the road that leads to _Mirador de los Poleos_ will
lead you to the Teide National Park. The park covers most of the center of the
island, around mount Teide.

The sunsets were beautiful, unreal. I watched so many that at one point I almost
thought I’ve had enough. Almost. Because whenever I saw the next one, it was
different. Unique in its own way. And every afternoon I found myself looking
forward to the next one.

Teide National Park, center of the island.

Cider, dark chocolate, feet buried in the warm sand, a cold breeze in my face.

Back tu zurich: no Snow, Green trees. Ppl everywhere.

Getting back home, COVID test.
